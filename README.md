# Case Study
In recent years, youths have been afraid to express their thoughts or dilemmas to the public in order to avoid being labeled as odd or strange, which has harmed their self-esteem. This recurring predicament has had an impact on young people's mental health, as seen by recent reports on the number of young people who commit suicide around the world.

# Problem Statement
Most youths do not have a safe space for airing their opinion or seeking help when it comes to their mental health and when they speak up, they get mocked or attacked by people close to them or on various social media platforms. How do we improve the confidence of young people to share their thoughts and feelings in order to promote balanced mental health by 2030.

# Solution
Our team will create an app that promotes anonymity while also allowing users to interact with mental health counselors. The app also allows users to come out of anonymity and reveal themselves whenever they want. They can also choose from a variety of interests such as technology, politics, wellness, and counseling. When they click on interests other than wellness and counseling, it takes them to a newsfeed where they can interact and connect with others. When they click on wellness and counseling, they are taken to a screen where they can view a list of certified counselors on our App. They can click on any of these counselors to view their profile and also chat wIth them.
