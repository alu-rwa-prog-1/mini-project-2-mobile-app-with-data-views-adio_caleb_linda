# Case Study
In recent years, youths have been afraid to express their thoughts or dilemmas to the public in order to avoid being labeled as odd or strange, which has harmed their self-esteem. This recurring predicament has had an impact on young people's mental health, as seen by recent reports on the number of young people who commit suicide around the world.

# Problem Statement
Most youths do not have a safe space for airing their opinion or seeking help when it comes to their mental health and when they speak up, they get mocked or attacked by people close to them or on various social media platforms. How do we improve the confidence of young people to share their thoughts and feelings in order to promote balanced mental health by 2030.

# Solution
Our team will create an app that promotes anonymity while also allowing users to interact with mental health counselors. The app also allows users to come out of anonymity and reveal themselves whenever they want. They can also choose from a variety of  mental health issues  such as Depression, Suicide, Anxiety, and Bullying. When they click on any  of the afforementioned mental health issue , it takes them to a newsfeed where they can interact and connect with other.

Note: you will realise that the app's folder are named after mitup however we later decided to call it safeSpace, as our goal is to create a safe space for our users. we therefore didn't change the folder's name to prevent any conflicts in the app.
